# WallpaperSplitter
Do you have that annoying issue where you want to have a two-screen wallpaper and Windows puts them the wrong way around? WallpaperSplitter wil fix this by splitting your wallpapers in two halves and reversing them. The result gets saved in a seperate folder so that all your original wallpapers are safe.

## Features
 - Supports any wallpaper size
 - Supports multiple image formats
 - Saves result in seperate folder
 
## Setup
If you're just interested in the program you can simply grab `WallpaperSplitter.exe` from the root directory.
Do note that you'll need the .NET Framework for this to work.

If you want to look at the source code, you can find it in `WallpaperSplitter/Program.cs` and if you want to run the entire project or fiddle around with it you'll need the entire repository. Enjoy!

## Usage
Simply enter the path to the directory with your wallpapers when prompted and the rest is automated.

You can find the result in the directory you specified in a new folder called "Splitter output".
