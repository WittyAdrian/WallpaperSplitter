Do you have that annoying issue where you want to have a two-screen wallpaper and Windows puts them the wrong way around? WallpaperSplitter wil fix this by splitting your wallpapers in two halves and reversing them. The result gets saved in a seperate folder so that all your original wallpapers are safe.

## Features

 - Supports multiple image formats
 - Saves result in seperate folder
 
## Usage
Simply enter the path to the directory with your wallpapers when prompted and the rest is automated.

You can find the result in the directory you specified in a new folder called "Splitter output".
